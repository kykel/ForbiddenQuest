Strange lights with no apparent source shimmer across the surface of the dark water.  It is impossible to tell the depth.  The waters tremble, yet the woods are still and silent.  A cold shiver moves across your skin as you approach.

A dark creature rises from the surface, its skin slick as oil.  You feel your sanity crawling away in your mind, desperate in self-preservation.  The world spins and the darkness of the creatures skin is like the void outside of time.  
A stench fills your nostrils and floods you with dread.  Your mind runs but you are frozen. Awareness of the woods around you crumbles, only you and the creature of nightmares exist in this moment.  
Time unravels and you feel sick from the vertigo.
