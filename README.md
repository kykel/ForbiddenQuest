# Forbidden Quest

Forbidden Quest is a WIP text based game written in Python 2.7, developed as an initial project while learning Python. It has since grown, little bit by little bit over the years with upgrades to the code and additional features. It is still very much a work in progress project.

The intention of Forbidden Quest is to become an interactive story based text game with a deeper developed storyline you discover as you play and that your choices can ultimately affect outcome of.

# Intended Features (Many still WIP)
Includes a quest building script under the developers directory that allows you to map a dungeon and associated text through a prompt game, a sort of interactive dungeon building game. This dungeon is saved as a JSON data model that can be loaded directly into the main game.

- Text based storyline
- Modular quest building
- Battles 
- Classes
- Stores
- Boss battles with special combat features
- Various interactive forms of play (prompts, 2D mappable dungeons, etc.)

# To-Do List
- Upgrade code to more efficient data-model driven format
- Convert to Python 3
- Finish Quest Builder script
